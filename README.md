# üöÄ LLM-Driven DevOps Automation  

## Overview  

This repository demonstrates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be leveraged for **automated DevOps alert resolution**, focusing on disk usage alerts as one of many possible use cases.  

In this implementation, **IBM Watsonx AI** (deployed on-premises) processes incoming alerts and generates structured troubleshooting steps to assist DevOps teams in faster issue resolution. However, this approach is not limited to Watsonx AI‚Äîany LLM (such as OpenAI's GPT, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude) can be used to achieve similar automation.

## **Why Use LLMs for DevOps Alerting?**  

Traditional monitoring and alerting solutions (e.g., Prometheus + Alertmanager, Datadog, Splunk) notify DevOps engineers about issues but often lack **contextual resolution steps**. LLMs bridge this gap by:  

‚úÖ **Automating Troubleshooting** ‚Äì Generating detailed, step-by-step remediation guides.  
‚úÖ **Reducing MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)** ‚Äì Speeding up resolution by eliminating repetitive diagnostics.  
‚úÖ **Enhancing Collaboration** ‚Äì Formatting output for Slack, Teams, or other communication channels.  
‚úÖ **Scaling Knowledge** ‚Äì Providing expert-level guidance even to junior engineers.

## **Use Case: Handling High Disk Usage Alerts**  

One example implementation in this repo demonstrates how an LLM processes a **high disk usage alert** and responds with actionable troubleshooting steps.  

### **How It Works**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Alert Detection:** Monitoring tools detect an issue (e.g., `/tmp` disk usage exceeding 85%).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM Processing:** The alert details are passed to **Watsonx AI**, which generates structured troubleshooting steps.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Slack Notification:** The generated response is formatted in Markdown for **Slack** or **Teams** to assist engineers.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Resolution & Automation:** Engineers follow suggested actions, or automation scripts execute cleanup tasks.

## **Example Output (Slack-Formatted Troubleshooting Guide)**  
*Troubleshooting High Disk Usage*
All suggestions provided below should be considered with extreme care to avoid any unintended consequences.


*Step 1: Check Disk Usage*
Check the current disk usage on the /tmp mount point using the command:
```bash
df -h /tmp
```
Verify that the usage is indeed high and identify the main contributors to the high usage.


*Step 2: Identify Large Files and Directories*
Use the following command to find large files and directories:
```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 /tmp
```
This will help identify which files or directories are consuming the most space.


*Step 3: Clean Up Temporary Files*
Remove any unnecessary files from the /tmp directory. Be cautious when deleting files to avoid removing important dat
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/*
```
Use this command with caution and only after verifying that the files are not in use.


*Step 4: Check for Open Files*
Use the `lsof` command to check for open files in the /tmp directory:
```bash
lsof +D /tmp
```
This will help identify any processes that may be holding onto files and preventing them from being deleted.


*Step 5: Monitor Disk Usage*
Continuously monitor the disk usage to ensure that it returns to a safe level after cleanup.
```bash
watch -n 1 df -h /tmp
```

## **Expanding Beyond Disk Usage**  

LLMs can be extended to handle multiple DevOps alerting scenarios, such as:  

üîπ **CPU & Memory Spikes** ‚Äì Diagnosing high resource utilization.  
üîπ **Service Failures** ‚Äì Suggesting restart commands & log analysis.  
üîπ **Network Latency Issues** ‚Äì Troubleshooting connectivity problems.  
üîπ **Security Alerts** ‚Äì Analyzing unusual access patterns or failed logins.  
üîπ **Kubernetes Failures** ‚Äì Recommending `kubectl` commands for pod recovery.  

By integrating LLMs with observability stacks, we can create **self-healing infrastructure** that automates problem detection and resolution.

## **What is IBM Watsonx AI?**  

[IBM Watsonx AI](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx) is an **enterprise-grade AI platform** designed for **on-premises** and **hybrid cloud** deployments. It enables organizations to build, train, and deploy AI models securely while maintaining full data control.  

### **Key Features of Watsonx AI for DevOps**  

‚úÖ **On-Prem Deployment** ‚Äì Ensures **data privacy** and compliance.  
‚úÖ **Fine-Tuned Models** ‚Äì Customizes AI models for specific DevOps workflows.  
‚úÖ **Seamless API Integration** ‚Äì Connects with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Splunk, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Multi-LLM Support** ‚Äì Works with both IBM‚Äôs models and third-party LLMs.  

Watsonx AI makes it possible to run **LLM-powered automation** without exposing sensitive infrastructure data to public cloud models.  

---

## **Getting Started**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Watsonx AI (or any LLM)**  

You can use any LLM **(on-prem)** or integrate with other LLM APIs like OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Hugging Face models.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the Alert Processing Script**  

Modify the `alert_handler.py` script to capture incoming alerts and format LLM responses.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate with Slack or Teams**  

Use Slack‚Äôs Web API or Microsoft Teams' Adaptive Cards to send responses to your incident management channel.

## **Future Enhancements**  

üöÄ **Automated Remediation** ‚Äì Trigger cleanup scripts directly from LLM suggestions.  
üöÄ **Multi-Alert Handling** ‚Äì Expand support for CPU, memory, network, and security alerts.  
üöÄ **Observability Integration** ‚Äì Enhance with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry.
